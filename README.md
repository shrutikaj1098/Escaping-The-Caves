# Modern Cryptology Assignments

Welcome to the "Modern Cryptology Assignments" repository! This repository contains my work for the CS641 Modern Cryptology course, taught by Prof. Manindra Agrawal. In this course, I delved into the fascinating world of cryptography, exploring various cryptosystems and deciphering their complexities.

## Course Overview

In the CS641 course, we studied a range of cryptosystems, including the Substitution cipher, PlayFair cipher, EAEAE, and DES. Through rigorous analysis and hands-on assignments, I gained a deep understanding of cryptographic algorithms and their vulnerabilities.

## Assignments

Each assignment in this repository corresponds to a different cryptosystem or cryptographic concept. I've implemented and analyzed these assignments, employing techniques such as frequency analysis, differential cryptanalysis, and more.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- `SubstitutionCipher`: Contains the implementation and analysis of the Substitution cipher.
- `PlayFairCipher`: Focuses on the PlayFair cipher's implementation, analysis, and decoding.
- `EAEAE`: Explores the EAEAE cryptosystem, implementing attacks and decryption techniques.
- `DES`: Covers the Data Encryption Standard (DES), including its implementation and analysis.

## Usage
